							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/beach.jpg" alt="" /></span>If you found your way to this link, then I’m happy that you want to know more about me! I was born and raised in Long Beach, California and one of my favorite fun facts is that Snoop Dogg and Cameron Diaz both went to my high school. I’m a huge Marvel fan and film in general. Although I’ve broken five bones, I still try to be as active as possible through biking, basketball, boxing, and tricking. A newfound passion of mine is the culinary arts and I love baking more than anything. Molecular gastronomy is essentially just edible chemistry and science and just seeing friends and family enjoy the food I make is a reward in itself. </p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/japan.jpg" alt="" /></span>All my life, I really felt like I was on the path of medicine with both of my parents being nurses and a perceived passion for medicine that was supplemented with volunteer work and the courses I took. In college, I began my journey as a Psychology and Neurobiology double major with the intention to apply to medical school, but a litany of other classes I took expounded my interests in various subjects and I didn’t believe the trajectory I was currently heading down would be satisfactory in where I wanted to best place my efforts. </p>
							<p>I’ve always been intrigued by computers and technology, but primarily, my passions lie within the brain and brain computer interfaces. I eventually ceased my Psychology major and instead chose Cognitive Science at Berkeley which was a multidisciplinary degree program composed of elements of philosophy, computer science, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, and neuroscience. What really made me fall in love with this field was a class I took on the Computational Models of Cognition my senior year where I was exposed to Rescorla-Wagner models and heuristic neural networks. I barely began my coding career during my final year at Berkeley so I didn’t think that I held the necessary experience to translate my courses into a career. Eventually, I found my way to App Academy and was fortunate enough to enroll in a coding bootcamp that equipped me with the necessary tools to be successful in the tech field. I’m hungry and excited to get my foot in the door and join a team where I can provide value day in and day out.</p>
							<p>The field I would love to break into is Neurotech and the application of artificial intelligence, neural networks, and behavioral neuroeconomics to tap into the inner workings of the mind.I always say that if there’s some world breaking, dystopian technological advancement that I would love to be at the forefront of it. If Elon Musk is crafting a robot to go to the store for us and buy us groceries, that would be such an interesting world to live in because the totality of our population would not welcome a sight like that within the confines of their daily lives. Yuval Noah Harari writes in his novel “Homo Deus” that the next evolution of man will be constituted by implants or other technology that will augment our lives for the better. There’s going to be so much regulation as to what projects are ethically viable and socially acceptable and I believe that oversight into these advancements is much needed. Regardless, if you’ve ever heard of Roko’s Basilisk, it’s one of the reasons why I think this field is so amazing. Maybe I’ve just been consuming way too much dystopian fiction but every day new innovations change the world and I just want to be on the right side of human history. </p>
